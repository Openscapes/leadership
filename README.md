# Openscapes 

## Hello and welcome!

### What is Openscapes?

<p>Openscapes works to increase the value and practice of environmental open data science through community, code, and data, so that scientists can efficiently and collaboratively find solutions to environmental challenges. </p>


### Who created Openscapes?

<p>Openscapes is being developed by Julie Lowndes, a marine data scientist and Mozilla Fellow based at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). This project follows [Mozilla's Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). The website and contributing guidelines are under development; please stay tuned!</p>
